![.NET Action Workflow Result](https://github.com/antonybstack/AdventOfCode/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

Taking part in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge in 2023 for the first time. I will be using C# 12 to solve the puzzles.

## What is Advent of Code?
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
